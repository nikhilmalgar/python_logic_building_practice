## 📖 About This Repository

This repository is dedicated to practicing and improving **logic building using Python**.  
It was created with the idea that mastering small coding exercises is the first step toward becoming a strong problem solver and a better programmer.

The programs included here are not just random exercises — they cover **fundamental concepts** like:
- Working with numbers (e.g., Armstrong, Palindrome, Prime, Factorial)  
- Understanding loops and recursion (e.g., Fibonacci, Reverse a Number)  
- Practicing conditional logic (e.g., Perfect Number, Strong Number)  
- Strengthening basics for **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** preparation  

### 🎯 Purpose of This Repository
- To provide **simple and clear Python examples** that anyone can learn from.  
- To act as a **reference hub** for beginners who want to practice logic-building programs.  
- To gradually build a **foundation for competitive programming, interviews, and advanced topics**.  
- To encourage learners to not just copy code but to understand the **logic behind it**.  

Whether you are a **student preparing for placements**, a **beginner learning Python**, or someone who just wants to **improve logical thinking**, this repo will be helpful for you.
